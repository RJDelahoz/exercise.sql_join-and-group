# For each employee who represents customers, output the total # of orders that employeeâ€™s customers have placed
# alongside the total sale amount of those orders.
# The employee name should be output as a single column named Sales Rep formatted as lastName, firstName.
# The second column should be titled # Orders and the third should be Total Sales.
# Sort the output by Total Sales descending.
# Only (and all) employees with the job title Sales Rep should be included in the output, and if the employee made no
# sales the Total Sales should display as 0.00.
